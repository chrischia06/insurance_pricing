### Task 
Predict the probability of claiming auto insurance and the amount claimed (imbalanced classification and censored regression)

Most effective method - logistic regression (F1 ~ 0.20) and gradient boosting regression (R2 ~ 0.5)


### Exploration for next time

Undersampling, SMOTE, further explore target encoding, more GLM (gamma regression?), more probabilistic / statistical methods
